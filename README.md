# Handwritten-Address-Recognition-System


Introduction : 
Unlike humans which have the high capability to easily understand the texts from a text image, machines are not intelligent enough to recognise
the text available in image. Therefore, a large number of efforts have been put forward that try to transform a handwritten text image to
machine understandable form. Handwritten Recognition System is a software which converts handwritten and printed text and images into digitized 
form such that it can be stored in the database and can be manipulated by machine whenever required. This involves scanning of the text envelope
horizontally and vertically to get individual words and then character, extraction of features to form feature vector, and then recognition of
character using the classifier.
